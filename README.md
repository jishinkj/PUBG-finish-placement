# PUBG Finish Placement Prediction

We are provided with a large number of anonymized PUBG game stats, formatted so that each row contains one player's post-game stats. The data comes from matches of all types: solos, duos, squads, and custom; there is no guarantee of there being 100 players per match, nor at most 4 player per group.

We must create a model which predicts players' finishing placement based on their final stats, on a scale from 1 (first place) to 0 (last place).
